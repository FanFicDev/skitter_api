skitter_api is a small wrapper around a set of FlareSolverr instances for load
balancing and redundancy purposes. Essentially a series of docker containers
comprised of gluetun providing a VPN connection and FlareSolverr providing CF
workarounds are kept alive and proxied to.

Currently these workers choose from a shared queue table stored in postgres;
this is for ease-of-adapting from a previous project that was trivially
shardable. This is far from ideal for a number of reasons. There's an initial
effort to move to rabbitmq queues instead.

Ensure you create a valid etc/nginx/auth/skitter.htpasswd file.

/etc/hosts on the deploy target should contain an entry for polaris.fanfic.dev

Regenerate the docker-compose.yml file:
	cd docker/
	./gen_docker_compose.sh > ./docker-compose.yml

Create the secret files:
	./docker/openvpn_user
	./docker/openvpn_password
(these should be single line files ending)

This depends on the same sql that python-weaver does.

Copy priv.ex.py to priv.py, generate a random api key, and optionally set a
NODE_NAME.
